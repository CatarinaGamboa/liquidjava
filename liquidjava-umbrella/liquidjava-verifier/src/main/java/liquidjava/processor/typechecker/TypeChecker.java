    * My idea is to separate typing rules to external class.
    * This will unbind typing from traversing java syntax tree.
    * Also, it will make adding new typing rules easier.
    *
    * There is already a TypeChecker class, but I want to make it closer to
    * formalization of Liquid Java.
    *
    * I do not know if it is possible or useful, so I am creating this pull request to discuss.
