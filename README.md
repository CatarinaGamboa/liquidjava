# ReGen: Evolutionary Synthesis-based Program Repair from Refined Types

To build the tool run:

```
sudo ./setup.sh
```

The sudo is needed so it automatically creates the ```.jpf``` folder with the site.properties file. If you feel unsafe about this operation, you can simply do ```./setup.sh``` and follow the instructions in the jpf-core page for instalation. The tool requires jpf-symbc and jpf-core which are automatically cloned into your machine.
