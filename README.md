# LiquidJava - Extending Java with Liquid Types

![LiquidJava Banner](docs/design/figs/banner.gif)


### Welcome to LiquidJava!

LiquidJava is an additional typechecker for Java that supports liquid types and typestate.

Simple example:


```java
@Refinement("a > 0")
int a = 3; // okay
a = -8; // type error!
```

This project has the LiquidJava verifier, the api and some examples for testing.
You can find out more about LiquidJava in the following resources:

## Setup the project
1. Clone the repository;
2. Open Eclipse and do `ÃŒmport...\ Existing Maven Project` selecting the project folder `liquidjava` and waiting for the build process to finish (bottom right update bar)
3. Select the `liquidjava-umbrella` folder, right click it and select `Run as...\Maven install...`
4. If inside the `liquidjava-verifier` build path there is not a `target/generated-sources/antr4`: Select `liquidjava-verifier`, on right-click, go to `Build Path\Link Source...` and browse for `liquidjava-verifier\target\generated-sources\antlr4` and select `Finish`

## Run verification
#### In a specific project
Run the file `liquidjava-verifier\api\CommandLineLaucher` with the path to the target project for verification.
If there are no arguments given, the application verifies the project on the path `liquidjava-example\src\main\java`.

#### JUnit tests
Inside the folder `liquidjava-verifier\api\tests` are three classes that test several examples available at `liquidjava-example\src\test\java`.
To run the JUnit tests in one of the files, select it, right-click it and `Run as...\JUnit tests`.
To run the all test suit, select the package `tests` (`liquidjava-verifier\api\tests`), right-click it, and do `Run as...\JUnit tests`.
Make sure to run these tests after making changes in the verification code.

## Project structure
- **docs**: documents used for the design of the language. The folder includes a readme to a full artifact used in the design process, here are some initial documents used to prepare the design of the refinements language at its evaluation
- **liquidjava-umbrella**: maven project with the different sub-folders with api, examples and the verifier.
    - **liquidjava-api**: inlcudes the annotations that can be introduced in the Java programs to add the refinements
    - **liquidjava-examples**: includes a main folder with the current example that the verifier is testing; and inlcudes the classes for the tests
    - **liquidjava-verifier**: has the project for verification of the classes
        - *api*: classes that test the verifier. Includes the `CommandLineLauncher` that runs the verification on a given class or on the main folder of `liquidjava-examples` if no argument is given. This package includes the JUnit tests to verify if the examples in `liquidjava-example/tests` are correctly verified.
        - *ast*: represents the abstract syntax tree of the refinement's language.
        - *errors*: package for reporting the errors.
        - *processor*: package that handles the type checking.
        - *rj_language*: handles the processing of the strings with refinements.
        - *smt*: package that handles the translation to the smt solver and the processing of the results the smt solver produces.
        - *utils*: includes useful methods for all the previous packages.
